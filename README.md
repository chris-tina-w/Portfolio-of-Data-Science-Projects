# *Christina's Data Science Portfolio*
Welcome to my repository of data science projects! With a background in medicine, I have been eagerly exploring the world of data science through academic study and self-directed learning. 

This collection highlights my journey of building technical skills and applying them to interesting real-world datasets and challenges. My goal is to bridge the gap between data and meaningful insights.   

# Project 1
**SQL and Tableau**
[Famous Artists and their Works: Exhibition, Value and Influence](https://public.tableau.com/views/FamousArtistsandtheirWorks/Art?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
