# Christina's Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my repository of data science projects which has been created through **_academic_** (Master of Data Science) and **_self-learning_** (textbooks, online courses) pursuits. 

With a background in <ins>*Medicine*</ins> and <ins>*business consulting*</ins>, I love bringing new perspectives on my journey in Data Science which is grounded in *critical thinking* and looking at projects with the *larger business objectives* in mind.

Feel free to explore this space as I continue to develop my skills and intuition in the exciting realm of data science.
