# Christina's Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my repository of data science projects which has been created through academic (Master of Data Science) and self-learning (textbooks, online courses) pursuits. 

With a background in *Medicine* and *business consulting*, I try to bring new perspectives on my journey in Data Science which is grounded in critical thinking and looking at projects with the larger business objective in mind.
