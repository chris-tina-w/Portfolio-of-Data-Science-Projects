# *Christina's Data Science Portfolio*
Welcome to my repository of data science projects! With a background in medicine, I am exploring the world of data science through academic study and self-directed learning. 

This collection highlights my journey of building technical skills and applying them to interesting real-world datasets and challenges. My goal is to bridge the gap between data and meaningful insights through machine learning and AI.

# Project 1: SQL and Tableau
In this project, I analysed a dataset featuring famous artists and their works using SQL and Tableau which showed that:
- Significant collections are concentrated in a few countries
- Few artists have reached an international audience, with many of their works confined to private collections
- Shifts in artistic preference influence what is displayed in museums and what holds value in the art market

### **Methodology**
- Designed an [**ER Diagram**](Famous%20Paintings/Art%20ER%20Diagram.jpg) to model the database structure.
- Performed [**Data Preprocessing**](Famous%20Paintings/art_preprocessing.ipynb) using Python and MySQL connector, including removing duplicates, changing data types, and creating primary and foreign keys.
- Executed [**SQL Queries**](Famous%20Paintings/art%20sql.ipynb) with MySQL.
- Developed an interactive [**Tableau Dashboard**](https://public.tableau.com/views/FamousArtistsandtheirWorks/Art?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to visualise the queries. (Screenshots of the dashboards can be found [here](Famous%20Paintings/Dashboards/art%20dashboards.md))

### **ToolKit**
- Python, MySQL, MySQL.Connector, Pandas, Tableau
