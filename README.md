# Christina's Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my repository of data science projects which have been created through academic (Master of Data Science) and self-learning (textbooks, online courses) pursuits. 

With a background in medicine and business consulting, I strive to bring new perspectives on my journey in Data Science which is grounded in <ins>critical thinking</ins> and looking at projects with the <ins>larger business objectives</ins> in mind.

Feel free to explore my portfolio as I continue to develop my skills and intuition in the exciting realm of data science.
